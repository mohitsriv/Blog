I've been waiting a long time -- almost six+ years since the time Microsoft released Windows Phone to supersede [Windows Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile) -- for Microsoft to bring back the feature where you can type SMS messages on your desktop and send them through your phone. Thankfully, this feature, as well as the ability to get alerts when you miss a phone call, is [now here](http://www.winbeta.org/news/cortana-can-finally-send-sms-messages-offer-missed-call-alerts-in-latest-windows-10-desktop-build) with build 10565 for desktops. Both features are working great, but it took me one key step and a bit of reading to wrap my head around it.

# Feature overview #

After initially reading about the feature on various blogs, I wasn't sure if the send SMS feature requires Skype or any kind of additional download on the desktop. Turns out, you just need Windows 10 build 10565 of later. On your phone, you need Windows 10 [build 10572](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/10/20/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-10572/) or later.

On the desktop, the feature is integrated **really** seamlessly. It's just part of Cortana. You get started either by speaking (e.g. "Hey Cortana, send a text") or typing into the "Ask me anything" input box:

In addition, it's also nice to be able to see missed phone calls. This is just part of the Windows 10 Action Center:
