I recently gave the following talk to the Chinese Institute of Engineers on the Microsoft campus.  The talk is an introduction to Search Engine Marketing (SEM), focusing on Search Advertising and Search Engine Optimization. I also explain the search business model and ranking algorithm to the extent that is needed to effectively implement SEM.

Much of the detail comes from my experience at Faves.com, where we were able to achieve over one million visits originating via organic search each month.

The audience was great â€” asking lots of questions and validating the broad applicability of SEM to a variety of businesses.  Enjoy!
