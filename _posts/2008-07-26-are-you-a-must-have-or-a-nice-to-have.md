I remember being asked this — with the implication that we should strive to be a “must-have” — when we were doing our initial fundraising round for Blue Dot (now Faves.com).  At first, I thought the distinction between a “must-have” and a “nice-to-have” is somewhat arbitrary.  But, scoping the question to “Are you a “must-have” for a paying customer or would be acquirer?” has helped me get my head around it.

If you are building a straight B2B product, your customers’ ultimate goal is to increase profits.  So, a “must-have” is something that helps your customers either cut costs or increase revenues.  The more convincingly you meet this definition of “must-have”, the easier the sales pitch.  Match this approach with someone in your organization who deeply understands and has relationships with your target customer segment, and you have a reasonable shot at success.

What if you’re a B2C company?  Unfortunately, it is harder to identify what it means to be a “must-have” for a consumer.  As I learned in the most recent StartPad talk, many VCs will not fund a consumer Web company unless it is attracting 3 million visitors a month.  Yikes!  These VCs realize it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict what will and will not stick with a mass market audience.

What can you do?  One approach is to stay laser focused on the B2C opportunity, employing trial-and-error, innovative product development, and/or creative marketing (e.g. Facebook, MySpace) to cross the 3 million visitor mark.  The thinking is that a) 3M is enough penetration to make money even on low performing ads and b) you have [crossed the chasm](http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Geoffrey-Moore/dp/0060517123) and empirically demonstrated you are a “must-have”.

An additional approach is to employ a B2B, and hence “increase profits for the customer”, angle in your B2C business.  Consider the consumer Web site example again.  This is in fact a [two-sided market](https://hbr.org/2006/10/strategies-for-two-sided-markets), in which the B2B side is the relationship between your company and the advertiser.  Design your site to offer a high ROI for advertisers, and you become a “must-have” for them.  They will pay you a higher-than-average amount for your pageviews, ultimately reducing the number of pageviews you need to reach positive cash flow.  A good example of such a site is a travel search engine, since a) the site visitor is making a purchase *now* and b) the dollar amount of the transaction is high.

Taking this one step further: by successfully creating such a revenue engine, you become interesting to other businesses.  You can then strike distribution deals with high traffic sites in exchange for access to your “must-have” revenue engine, and so on…
