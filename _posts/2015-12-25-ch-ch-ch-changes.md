Needless to say, lots has happened in the **six** years since the last post. The industry has evolved. I've evolved. 
That means I read some of my old posts and cringe a bit. I'm still happy though I went through the exercise of
blogging, taking out some time to reflect on topics that were top of mind then. <!--more--> And, I have kept all but two
of the original posts following the migration. With that in mind, I'm going to try to pick up the habit again 
but not set a hard commitment either.

Here are some of the things that will be reflected upcoming posts.

# New tech

I've migrated the blog engine from WordPress + MySQL to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Microsoft Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/). I author my
posts on [GitHub](http://github.com) in Markdown and then use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to automate testing, building and publishing to Azure. I am quite satisifed
with the whole workflow and plan to share the details in an upcoming post. 

# Changes (industry and personal)

- Product Management itself has evolved significantly at Microsoft
- More to come
