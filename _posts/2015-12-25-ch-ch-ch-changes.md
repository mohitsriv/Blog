Needless to say, lots has happened in the **six** years since the last post. The industry has evolved. I've evolved. 
That means I read some of my old posts and cringe a bit (a lot). I'm still happy though I went through the exercise of
blogging, taking out some time to reflect on topics that were top of mind then. With that in mind, I'm going to try to pick up the habit again 
but not set a hard commitment either. <!--more-->

Here are some of the things that will be reflected in upcoming posts.

# New tech

I've migrated the blog engine from WordPress + MySQL to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Microsoft Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/). I author my
posts on [GitHub](http://github.com/mohitsriv/Blog) in Markdown and then use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to automate testing, building and publishing to Azure. I am quite satisifed
with the whole workflow and plan to share the details in an upcoming post. 

# Changes

- Product Management itself has evolved significantly at Microsoft, with greater focus on [customer development](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Customer-Development-Building-Customers/dp/1449356354), accountability for business impact, and an agile service-oriented "hyptohesize-test-repeat" culture. More to come.
- Consumer and enterprise software has moved to SaaS.
